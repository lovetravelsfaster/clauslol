This is a test MD doc
=====================

That was one style of header.

Here is a little bit longer of a paragraph. I am writing it all in one line to see how the line wrapping, if any, works in this case, and if the line breaks are going to look different than the line breaks I apply when I hit enter.

Like this.


* Bullet list
* Blabla


1. Number list
2. Number list


## Another header style


**Bold**  

*Cursive*  

***Bold and cursive***
