claus.LOL Site TODOs
====================

- [X] Implement `make deploy`
- [X] Clean up all lingering ysap.sh text
- [X] Double check all deps are checked in `make check-deps`
- [ ] Clean up unused code in `style.css`
- [ ] Create and use favicon
- [X] Figure out best pattern for including images
	- Decided on just a central /images folder so I can easily reuse an image across posts
