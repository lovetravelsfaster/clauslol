claus.LOL Site TODOs
====================

- [ ] Implement `make deploy`
- [ ] Clean up all lingering ysap.sh text
- [ ] Double check all deps are checked in `make check-deps`
- [ ] Clean up unused code in `style.css`
- [ ] Create and use favicon
- [ ] Figure out best pattern for including images
	- Maybe a folder per entry, instead just a .md?
	- Maybe use `YYYY-MM-DD-Img-name.jpg` file name convention in a separate img folder?
